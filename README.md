# Resume
This project was created as a simple and practical way to modernize the service provided by a snack bar. The idea is that, by accessing a link, customers can view the full menu, choose the items they want and easily place their order â€” all from their cell phone or computer. With this, we aim to make the experience faster, more organized and more comfortable, both for those ordering and for those serving.
